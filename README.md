# File-Search
Scans all files in a folder for matching regex. Useful for quickly searching in code.

Built with WinForm, so its not really platform compatible. To use it, simply make a build with visual studio and run it. If you want the notepad++ feature to work, you may wish to edit the textbox underneath to link to notepad++ executable.
